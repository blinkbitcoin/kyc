# Validates the deploy templates operators copy: the Compose file parses, the
# Cloudflare template actually bundles, and the k8s manifests are schema-valid.
#
# The Worker dry-run is the only real evidence that the Worker bundle excludes
# `pg` and Apollo - a guard test in packages/kyc-service reads TypeScript
# source, which cannot see what a bundler would pull in. So it must run in CI,
# not just on a laptop that happens to have wrangler installed: when wrangler
# is not on PATH this shells out to `npx --yes wrangler@$WRANGLER_MAJOR`, and
# only an npx that cannot fetch it (offline) is a skip. It bundles the
# template itself (deploy/cloudflare, whose entry re-exports
# @blinkbitcoin/kyc-service/cloudflare), so it needs the service's dist:
# run `npm run build` first. CI: E2E / Build Packages, right after the build.
# Local: make deploy-check.
#
# The bundle runs on a THROWAWAY COPY of the template: wrangler writes a
# `.wrangler/` working directory next to the config it was given, and the
# template is a tracked directory that ships inside the published tarball -
# a check must not leave anything in it. The copy gets a node_modules symlink
# so the entry's `@blinkbitcoin/kyc-service/cloudflare` still resolves to
# the workspace, and the template dir is asserted untouched afterwards.
