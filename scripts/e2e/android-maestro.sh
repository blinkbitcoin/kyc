# signing WebView loads localhost:4000 URLs minted by the mock provider), runs
# the suite and keeps device forensics (logcat) when it fails.
# Needs: emulator up, debug APK built, Metro + backend running (metro-start.sh,
# backend-up.sh). CI: the `script:` input of reactivecircus/android-emulator-
# runner, which executes each line as its own `sh -c` - hence a file, not
# inline shell. Local: make e2e-android.
