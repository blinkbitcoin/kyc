# Sourced by the e2e scripts: the one "poll until ready" loop, instead of a
# hand-rolled copy per script. Usage:
#   wait_for <name> <retries> <sleep-seconds> <log-file-or-""> <check command...>
# Runs the check command up to <retries> times, <sleep-seconds> apart, with
# its output discarded; prints "<name> is up" and returns 0 on the first
# success, otherwise "::error::<name> did not answer within Ns" plus the
# tail of the log file (when given) and returns 1.
# Two ready-made checks for HTTP endpoints:
#   http_ok <url>       2xx only (curl -f)
#   http_answers <url>  any 2xx or 4xx (a route that exists but rejects the probe)
