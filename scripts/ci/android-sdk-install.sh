# retry, so one bad download takes the whole Android E2E job down before
# Maestro ever runs: sdkmanager reports "An error occurred while preparing SDK
# package Android Emulator: Error on ZipFile unknown archive" and the action
# goes straight to killing an emulator that never started. Pre-installing makes
# the action's own sdkmanager call a no-op - it skips a package already at
# the current revision, the same property the system-image cache in e2e.yml
# relies on - so a corrupt archive costs a retry instead of the job.
