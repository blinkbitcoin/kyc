# E2E Postgres on a macOS runner (no Docker there): Homebrew postgresql@16 on
# KYC_TEST_DB_PORT (KYC_PORT_BASE + 4, scripts/lib/ports.mjs) with test/test +
# kyc_test, matching docker-compose.test.yml.
# Ephemeral data dir under $RUNNER_TEMP - the runner is disposable anyway.
#
# No auto-update: the first `brew install` on a fresh runner otherwise spends
# ~2.5 min refreshing taps and the formula index before it downloads anything
# (measured 155 s of a 220 s step). The image's pinned index is fine for a
# throwaway test database; if it ever lacks a postgresql@16 bottle the install
# fails loudly, which is the right signal to bump the image.
#
# Modes: `start` (default) installs, inits and starts the server; `wait`
# blocks until kyc_test accepts connections. The iOS job runs `start` in
# the background right after checkout (`background`, which also records the
# PID and log for `wait`) so the install overlaps npm ci, Maestro, the
# simulator pick and Metro, then calls `wait` right before migrations.
